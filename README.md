# Right-Realm
Rights Realm is a pioneering platform dedicated to educating and empowering children about their legal rights, like  Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the right to expression, and the right to development. We understand that children's understanding and interests evolve with age, which is why we have categorized our platform into two age groups: 8-12 and 12-15.

Right Realm is a dynamic and innovative platform designed to educate children about their rights while providing an engaging and interactive learning experience. With a special focus on the POCSO Act, the right to expression, and the right to development, our platform is dedicated to empowering children with knowledge that will help them make informed decisions, protect themselves, and advocate for their rights and the rights of others.
